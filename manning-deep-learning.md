Today, I am committing again to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This time, my goal is to go through all of Manning's learning materials on [Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/bundle-hub/deep-learning). And yes, I actually bought the first bundle. I'm intentionally twisting my arm into studying.

Got to read a bit more about machine learning and how computers learn. I'm getting a little tired now, so I might as well continue tomorrow. No point in forcing myself to study if I can't absorb what I'm reading.

So, didn't get the time to study today coz I went to IKEA to get some furniture. Took a while assembling stuff (and quite the cut on my finger) but now, my desk is so clean and clutter free. I guess that would help a bit to concentrate on studying. I'll definitely put a bunch of effort tomorrow. (Assuming nothing comes up.)

Got to read up and finish the second chapter of Grokking Deep Learning. Now I properly understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Not only that, I also found out that there's Parametric and Non-Parametric learning. I look forward especially to Chapter 3, where things will start to become really hands on.
