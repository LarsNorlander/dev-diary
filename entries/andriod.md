Alright. So since my next assignment will be Android development, I might as well get started learning the platform seriously. For starters, I’ve been going across the web to look for some resources. I’ve ended up deciding that the best way to learn is by building an app. Probably a notes app would work for now. I’ve started by generating a project with a basic activity and studied how the code looks like in Kotlin. I’ve seen simple Java Android apps before. But I’m kind of surprised by how simple and clean the Kotlin code looks.
