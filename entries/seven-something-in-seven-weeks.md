# Seven Something in Seven Weeks

## July 24, 2018

### 7:58 AM

After studying Python, I've decided to take up the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. I find the book really interesting and I like the idea of sampling several programming languages (six of them I've heard about) to learn what makes them unique and how they decide to do things. I also like how the author introduces the languages like characters.

### 6:12 PM

So, I've read Day 1 and Day 2 of the chapter on Ruby and have done the activities from Day 1. I intend on doing Day 2's activities tomorrow morning. While I was learning Ruby, I started to see a few parallels to Python. I also noticed a few differences with how they do things like how they treat inheritance. 

But it was the similarities that intrigued me. What triggered this specifically, was that you have the ability to define how the `+` operator worked on two objects. I suddenly remembered Groovy, a JVM language that I've used before but didn't end up liking too much. And then it clicked, I tried implementing a simple script where I have a Point class and I could add two points and return a new instance where their x and y values were added.

And what do you know, I suddenly had a new found appreciation for Groovy. I used to view it as basically Java, but with scripting thrown into it. Looking at it as a scripting language first with elements of Java completed changed how I saw the language. 

It turns out, learning new languages does widen your view. It gives you a new way to look at things and gives you a much deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. I'd say today was a good day for learning, and now, I'm even more curious to see what other languages the programming world has to offer.

### 7:57 AM

Got to do two out of the three activities for Day 2 in Ruby. Got a few errors here and there but that allowed me to understand how the language worked a little better.

### 6:49 PM

I've completed  all the Day 2 activities and have gotten a little more than halfway through Day 3 for Ruby. Reading got slowed down coz I ended up enjoying messing around with the language and trying out different stuff with it. I just find a few things weird, like `some_string.titleize`.

### 8:27 PM

I tried to read up a bit but unfortunately, I was a little too sick to even concentrate and had too heavy of a head. Maybe tomorrow would be a bit better?

## July 27, 2018

### 7:17 PM

I tried a small stint this morning but that wasn't so good since my head just pounded. But by the night, I was finally able to read up the rest of Ruby and completed the Day 3 activities. Ruby does look like a nice language and it does seem fun. Between Python and Ruby there is no clear winner for me just yet, but I do appreciate what the language is doing. Learning more than one scripting language has also helped give me a greater appreciation of them.

### 3:10 PM

Got to do Day 1 for Io and it's activities. It feels weird looking at the language but there's a weird charm to it. The biggest takeaway though is seeing how prototypes in Io work. I've always been puzzled about prototypes in JavaScript and this is shedding some light for me.

### 7:36 PM

Got to read a huge chunk of Day 2 for Io. Got to run a few scripts from from files and slightly got my head a little around the concept of messaging here.

## July 29, 2018

### 11:02 AM

Got to finish the chapter on Io. The language I think is an interesting one. The language is in a direct contrast with Ruby in terms of how much syntactic sugar there is, in Io there's absolutely none. But I was intrigued by the ability to basically implement your own syntax. That was kinda astonishing to see. Next up, Prolog.

### 5:26 PM

Got to read Day 1 of Prolog and got to do it's activities. This language is so amusing. I'm bewildered by how it works. You state some facts, a few rules, and it gives you the answer. It's just, how??? How does it do that? And the interview about from the dolphin researches was mind blowing to read.

## July 30, 2018

### 6:42 PM

Got to finish Day 2 of Prolog and the language is just twisting my brain in all sorts of ways. I have a shallow understanding of what's going on and it still amazes me how the language does what it does.

## July 31, 2018

### 7:22 PM

Got to finish the chapter on Prolog. I was amazed to see the language solve problems like sudoku. I'm not going to pretend like I fully understood the language but, I got a good grasp at what it's good at and I'm genuinely interested in revisiting this language in the future.

### 7:49 AM

Got to read the introduction to Scala and now I'm quite interested. I've heard about the language before but never got to learning it. I studied Kotlin instead though. But now that I'm studying the book Seven Languages in Seven weeks, here's my chance to get to know the language and how it mixes OOP with FP.

### 6:24 PM

Got to finish Day 1 of Scala. Day 1 pretty much introduces it's object oriented features and it's relation to Java. I also go to learn how companion objects work and traits. I've seen those concepts before in other languages but only actually got to try it out here.

## August 2, 2018

### 6:30 PM

Got to finish Day 2 of Scala. I've already encountered some of the functional concepts in Java but I like how easy and clean it is to use function currying in Scala.

## August 3, 2018

### 7:52 AM

Got to go through halfway of Day 3 for Scala. I'm surprised at the fact that XML syntax is supported in the language itself. The pattern matching feature is also cool. I've actually used it in Kotlin as the `when` expression. I'm actually seeing a lot of where Kotlin might have gotten it's inspiration from. 

## August 4, 2018

### 6:04 PM

Got to finish Scala today and read a bit on Erlang. I had some trouble with Scala for a bit because of some deprecated stuff in the book but I got over it. I find it cool to see Erlang now that I've seen Prolog and how Erlang is based on it.

## August 5, 2018

Didn't get to work on anything today because I spent the entire day out with family. I'll resume tomorrow.

## August 6, 2018

### 7:57 AM

Worked halfway through Erlang's 2nd day. It's interesting to see all the list processing methods here as the highlight of a functional language. I've used these in Java through the Streams API and I feel as if I'm seeing where the ideas for Java's functional features come from.

### 6:32 PM

Worked a little more through day 2 or Erlang. I didn't get to cover the entire section just yet. I'll most likely finish this up tomorrow.

## August 7, 2018

### 7:57 AM

Got to finish up day 2 for Erlang and have gone through some of the material for day 3. I found myself rather amused at the idea of spawning processes for the concurrency.

## August 8, 2018

### 7:54 AM

Got to finish up the chapter on Erlang and I've got to say, I was very impressed with how well you could do concurrency. It was also impressed with how it could easily monitor processes and restart them whenever needed. Now I get the "Let it crash" philosophy of the language and it's amazing.

## August 9, 2018

### 7:55 AM

Started reading up the chapter on Clojure and finally, I could write programs in Lisp-style language. ðŸ˜‚ It's quite fascinating really, writing code in a way that is just sooo different from what you're used to.

## August 10, 2018

### 9:50 AM

Got to finish up the first day of Clojure and that felt like a rather long one. It's probably because the language is so different from what I'm used to and I'm learning so much stuff. It's interesting to finally learn a Lisp dialect, one that works at the JVM too.

## August 11, 2018

### 1:42 PM

Finished up half of day 2 for Clojure. List processing is definitely it's forte! The more I use the language, the less foreign it starts to look.

## August 12, 2018

### 11:37 AM

Got to finish day 2 of Clojure. I was busy yesterday so I wasn't able to complete it. I'll definitely try and see if I could catch up on day 3.

### 1:38 PM

Got to finish up Clojure. While doing some reading on the web, I found myself smiling at the fact that I could understand some Lisp now. It's not too foreign to me anymore and now I want to learn more about it.

## August 13, 2018

### 12:38 PM

Got to finish up the first day of Haskell. I've got to say, the language is looking really nice for me. Admittedly, I've seen Haskell before but I never got to appreciate it till I saw the functional languages that came before it. 

## August 14, 2018

### 6:32 PM

Just got home from a long trip to the Swedish Embassy. I'll see if I could muster up the strength to do something today later.

## August 15, 2018

### 12:13 PM

I guess the answer to yesterday's question was no, I ended up falling asleep. Got to finish the second day of Haskell and got to learn how partially applied functions and currying works in Haskell. 

## August 16, 2018

### 10:38 AM

Got to finally finish up Haskell and the book. Now that I've explored seven languages I've never touched before, it feels like I've been soul searching... as a dev... if that makes sense. Now I want to try even more languages and my next stop, is Swift! Well, I want to do it mostly thanks to the book Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift. Here I go!
