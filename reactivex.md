One of the things I’ve always wanted to learn was doing reactive programming. Thanks to my new assignment with Android development, I now have a reason to prioritise learning it. As of now, I’m reading the book Learning RxJava. I’ve completed the chapter “Observables and Subscribers” and now, I think I have a good grasp of the foundations.

Today I got to study up on the different ReactiveX operations that could suppress, transform, reduce, collect, and respond to errors. I’ve also got to study up on the different ways you could combine observables through merging, concatenation, zipping, and grouping. A lot of this seems easy to pick up since it looks very similar to Java’s Streams API.
