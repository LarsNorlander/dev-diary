Shifted gears a bit from Swift to Kotlin for the time being. I'll get back to Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift after this. The reason I'm focusing more on Kotlin as of now is to refresh myself on it and I've suddenly had a particular need for it. I've started of by jumping to Hands-On Design Patterns with Kotlin and I've quickly just skimmed through the first chapter since it's just the basics of the language.

Started reading on how you could do some of the creational patterns in Kotlin and implementing the static factory pattern with companion objects. I went exploring today (around the city) and so what I've done today may be a little limited.

Got to finish reading up on the creational patterns in Kotlin and started out some of the structural patterns including the decorator, adapter, and bridge patterns. I was surprised to see how the `by` keyword makes it simpler to implement the decorator.

I was reading a little more on structural patterns. But then I got a surprise visit from a family member. I won't be counting this to my 100 Days of Code though since it was too little.

Read more about creational patterns and I'm nearly done with all of them. This book sure has a lot gamer humor.

Got to close up the chapter on structural patterns and started reading how the behavioral patterns would be implemented in Kotlin. One of the nice things about Kotlin's new features is that, it help in simplifying a lot of the patterns.
