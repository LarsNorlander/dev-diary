Shifted gears a bit from Swift to Kotlin for the time being. I'll get back to Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift after this. The reason I'm focusing more on Kotlin as of now is to refresh myself on it and I've suddenly had a particular need for it. I've started of by jumping to Hands-On Design Patterns with Kotlin and I've quickly just skimmed through the first chapter since it's just the basics of the language.

Started reading on how you could do some of the creational patterns in Kotlin and implementing the static factory pattern with companion objects. I went exploring today (around the city) and so what I've done today may be a little limited.
