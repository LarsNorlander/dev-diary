Shifted gears a bit from Swift to Kotlin for the time being. I'll get back to Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift after this. The reason I'm focusing more on Kotlin as of now is to refresh myself on it and I've suddenly had a particular need for it. I've started of by jumping to Hands-On Design Patterns with Kotlin and I've quickly just skimmed through the first chapter since it's just the basics of the language.

Started reading on how you could do some of the creational patterns in Kotlin and implementing the static factory pattern with companion objects. I went exploring today (around the city) and so what I've done today may be a little limited.

Got to finish reading up on the creational patterns in Kotlin and started out some of the structural patterns including the decorator, adapter, and bridge patterns. I was surprised to see how the `by` keyword makes it simpler to implement the decorator.

I was reading a little more on structural patterns. But then I got a surprise visit from a family member. I won't be counting this to my 100 Days of Code though since it was too little.

Read more about creational patterns and I'm nearly done with all of them. This book sure has a lot gamer humor.

Got to close up the chapter on structural patterns and started reading how the behavioral patterns would be implemented in Kotlin. One of the nice things about Kotlin's new features is that, it help in simplifying a lot of the patterns.

Got to read up on a bunch of behavioral patterns again. I'll also be joining a Java Meet Up soon so, that's all there is for today.

Well! I've been assigned to an Android team and well, it seems I'll finally get to professionally work with Kotlin! That means getting to see more serious applications of the language. I guess the great thing will be the fact that now, I'll have a better roadmap of what to study for the language.

Picking up a Kotlin book again to refresh my knowledge for my upcoming assignment. I’ll be working on Android and the team uses Kotlin primarily for all new stuff. I’m actually pretty excited to do something with Kotlin professionally since it’s been my favourite language since I’ve tried writing with it.

After quite a while of not logging to my Dev Diary, I’m finally doing it again. I’ve started off by reading the first chapter of the book The Joy of Kotlin. I’ve waited for this book for quite a while and I’m pretty excited to go through it.

Finished chapter 2 and most of chapter 3. Turns out, there’s a way to partially apply the second argument of a curried function, you could also do something like convert a normal function into a curried function. This will come in handy. At the moment, I’ve only really known to partially apply curried functions with their first argument only.
