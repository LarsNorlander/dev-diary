# Seven Something in Seven Weeks

## July 24, 2018

### 7:58 AM

After studying Python, I've decided to take up the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. I find the book really interesting and I like the idea of sampling several programming languages (six of them I've heard about) to learn what makes them unique and how they decide to do things. I also like how the author introduces the languages like characters.

### 6:12 PM

So, I've read Day 1 and Day 2 of the chapter on Ruby and have done the activities from Day 1. I intend on doing Day 2's activities tomorrow morning. While I was learning Ruby, I started to see a few parallels to Python. I also noticed a few differences with how they do things like how they treat inheritance. 

But it was the similarities that intrigued me. What triggered this specifically, was that you have the ability to define how the `+` operator worked on two objects. I suddenly remembered Groovy, a JVM language that I've used before but didn't end up liking too much. And then it clicked, I tried implementing a simple script where I have a Point class and I could add two points and return a new instance where their x and y values were added.

And what do you know, I suddenly had a new found appreciation for Groovy. I used to view it as basically Java, but with scripting thrown into it. Looking at it as a scripting language first with elements of Java completed changed how I saw the language. 

It turns out, learning new languages does widen your view. It gives you a new way to look at things and gives you a much deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. I'd say today was a good day for learning, and now, I'm even more curious to see what other languages the programming world has to offer.

Got to do two out of the three activities for Day 2 in Ruby. Got a few errors here and there but that allowed me to understand how the language worked a little better.

### 6:49 PM

I've completed  all the Day 2 activities and have gotten a little more than halfway through Day 3 for Ruby. Reading got slowed down coz I ended up enjoying messing around with the language and trying out different stuff with it. I just find a few things weird, like `some_string.titleize`.

I tried to read up a bit but unfortunately, I was a little too sick to even concentrate and had too heavy of a head. Maybe tomorrow would be a bit better?

I tried a small stint this morning but that wasn't so good since my head just pounded. But by the night, I was finally able to read up the rest of Ruby and completed the Day 3 activities. Ruby does look like a nice language and it does seem fun. Between Python and Ruby there is no clear winner for me just yet, but I do appreciate what the language is doing. Learning more than one scripting language has also helped give me a greater appreciation of them.

Got to do Day 1 for Io and it's activities. It feels weird looking at the language but there's a weird charm to it. The biggest takeaway though is seeing how prototypes in Io work. I've always been puzzled about prototypes in JavaScript and this is shedding some light for me.

### 7:36 PM

Got to read a huge chunk of Day 2 for Io. Got to run a few scripts from from files and slightly got my head a little around the concept of messaging here.

Got to finish the chapter on Io. The language I think is an interesting one. The language is in a direct contrast with Ruby in terms of how much syntactic sugar there is, in Io there's absolutely none. But I was intrigued by the ability to basically implement your own syntax. That was kinda astonishing to see. Next up, Prolog.

### 5:26 PM

Got to read Day 1 of Prolog and got to do it's activities. This language is so amusing. I'm bewildered by how it works. You state some facts, a few rules, and it gives you the answer. It's just, how??? How does it do that? And the interview about from the dolphin researches was mind blowing to read.

Got to finish Day 2 of Prolog and the language is just twisting my brain in all sorts of ways. I have a shallow understanding of what's going on and it still amazes me how the language does what it does.
