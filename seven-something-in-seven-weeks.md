# Seven Something in Seven Weeks

After studying Python, I've decided to take up the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. I find the book really interesting and I like the idea of sampling several programming languages (six of them I've heard about) to learn what makes them unique and how they decide to do things. I also like how the author introduces the languages like characters.

So, I've read Day 1 and Day 2 of the chapter on Ruby and have done the activities from Day 1. I intend on doing Day 2's activities tomorrow morning. While I was learning Ruby, I started to see a few parallels to Python. I also noticed a few differences with how they do things like how they treat inheritance. 

But it was the similarities that intrigued me. What triggered this specifically, was that you have the ability to define how the `+` operator worked on two objects. I suddenly remembered Groovy, a JVM language that I've used before but didn't end up liking too much. And then it clicked, I tried implementing a simple script where I have a Point class and I could add two points and return a new instance where their x and y values were added.

And what do you know, I suddenly had a new found appreciation for Groovy. I used to view it as basically Java, but with scripting thrown into it. Looking at it as a scripting language first with elements of Java completed changed how I saw the language. 

It turns out, learning new languages does widen your view. It gives you a new way to look at things and gives you a much deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. I'd say today was a good day for learning, and now, I'm even more curious to see what other languages the programming world has to offer.

Got to do two out of the three activities for Day 2 in Ruby. Got a few errors here and there but that allowed me to understand how the language worked a little better.

### 6:49 PM

I've completed  all the Day 2 activities and have gotten a little more than halfway through Day 3 for Ruby. Reading got slowed down coz I ended up enjoying messing around with the language and trying out different stuff with it. I just find a few things weird, like `some_string.titleize`.

I tried to read up a bit but unfortunately, I was a little too sick to even concentrate and had too heavy of a head. Maybe tomorrow would be a bit better?
