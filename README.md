# freeCodeCamp Diary

On the 17th day of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, I kinda hit a stump. I have a project that's written in Kotlin and I'd like to
write a frontend for it. Unfortunately, I haven't touched frontend code in, well, forever. And so I've decided to reboot my 
frontend skills with freeCodeCamp. This diary is something I intend as part of my #100Days of Code and will update it for 
every sprint I do. Basically if I do work in the morning I update this. If I do work again in the night, I update it again.

This is to hold myself liable, and I could type a lot more here than in Twitter. I'm currently writing this in a salon while 
waiting for my haircut and it's great how fast their wifi is. What I mean to say is, this is going to be a really messy diary. 
Have fun going through my messy brain's raw thoughts! (Or not.)
