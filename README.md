# freeCodeCamp Diary

## June 11, 2018

### 5:43 PM
On the 17th day of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, I kinda hit a stump. I have a project that's written in Kotlin and I'd like to write a frontend for it. Unfortunately, I haven't touched frontend code in, well, forever. And so I've decided to reboot my frontend skills with freeCodeCamp. This diary is something I intend as part of my #100Days of Code and will update it for every sprint I do. Basically if I do work in the morning I update this. If I do work again in the night, I update it again.

This is to hold myself liable, and I could type a lot more here than in Twitter. I'm currently writing this in a salon while waiting for my haircut and it's great how fast their wifi is. What I mean to say is, this is going to be a really messy diary. Have fun going through my messy brain's raw thoughts! (Or not.)

So, I just speeded through freeCodeCamps Basic HTML and HTML5 in the Responsive Web Design Certification after I got home and had dinner. I found that I knew a lot of the topics and so I got through it really quickly. But that's the funny thing...

> I knew a lot of the topics

I was expecting to know most of it! There were so many little tidbits bits that I didn't know or didn't understand. Thing is, I was taking this to relearn frontend but it turns out, I'm actually learning it properly for the first time. I don't really find this disappointing, I'm actually excited by it! Here's to learning frontend, the right way.

I get to the office pretty early so I usually get a bunch of time to mess around. So this time, I got to start with freeCodeCamp's [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css). I went from [Change the Color of Text](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/change-the-color-of-text) to [Size Your Images](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/size-your-images) in about 30 minutes or so. I spent a little more time with each challenge this time because really, my understanding of CSS is pretty shallow.

Work ends at 5:00PM, and so I spent my time continuing the CSS challenges. This time around I went from [Add Borders Around Your Elements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/add-borders-around-your-elements) to [Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/use-attribute-selectors-to-style-elements). A funny thing that occurred to me was a particular question.

> Why is the unit `em` called that?

This lead to some searching until finally, I found that it's etymology is from typography! I've known in the past that frontend is influenced by some aspects of traditional media, but this was mind blowing for me. I don't know. I guess it's just, I find it amusing that in our day and age, we find inspiration for the technologies of the future in the way we used to do things in the past.

So this morning before work hours, I got to do [Understand Absolute versus Relative Units](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/understand-absolute-versus-relative-units) to [Override All Other Styles by using Important](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/override-all-other-styles-by-using-important). I think this section so far has had the most surprises. There are quite a few things I encountered that I had no idea about. It was also interesting to finally learn how which styles take precedence.
