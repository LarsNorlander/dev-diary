# freeCodeCamp Diary

## June 11, 2018

### 5:43 PM
On the 17th day of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, I kinda hit a stump. I have a project that's written in Kotlin and I'd like to write a frontend for it. Unfortunately, I haven't touched frontend code in, well, forever. And so I've decided to reboot my frontend skills with freeCodeCamp. This diary is something I intend as part of my #100Days of Code and will update it for every sprint I do. Basically if I do work in the morning I update this. If I do work again in the night, I update it again.

This is to hold myself liable, and I could type a lot more here than in Twitter. I'm currently writing this in a salon while waiting for my haircut and it's great how fast their wifi is. What I mean to say is, this is going to be a really messy diary. Have fun going through my messy brain's raw thoughts! (Or not.)

### 8:43 PM

So, I just speeded through freeCodeCamps Basic HTML and HTML5 in the Responsive Web Design Certification after I got home and had dinner. I found that I knew a lot of the topics and so I got through it really quickly. But that's the funny thing...

> I knew a lot of the topics

I was expecting to know most of it! There were so many little tidbits bits that I didn't know or didn't understand. Thing is, I was taking this to relearn frontend but it turns out, I'm actually learning it properly for the first time. I don't really find this disappointing, I'm actually excited by it! Here's to learning frontend, the right way.

I get to the office pretty early so I usually get a bunch of time to mess around. So this time, I got to start with freeCodeCamp's [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css). I went from [Change the Color of Text](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/change-the-color-of-text) to [Size Your Images](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/size-your-images) in about 30 minutes or so. I spent a little more time with each challenge this time because really, my understanding of CSS is pretty shallow.

### 6:13 PM

Work ends at 5:00PM, and so I spent my time continuing the CSS challenges. This time around I went from [Add Borders Around Your Elements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/add-borders-around-your-elements) to [Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/use-attribute-selectors-to-style-elements). A funny thing that occurred to me was a particular question.

> Why is the unit `em` called that?

This lead to some searching until finally, I found that it's etymology is from typography! I've known in the past that frontend is influenced by some aspects of traditional media, but this was mind blowing for me. I don't know. I guess it's just, I find it amusing that in our day and age, we find inspiration for the technologies of the future in the way we used to do things in the past.

### 7:53 AM

So this morning before work hours, I got to do [Understand Absolute versus Relative Units](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/understand-absolute-versus-relative-units) to [Override All Other Styles by using Important](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/override-all-other-styles-by-using-important). I think this section so far has had the most surprises. There are quite a few things I encountered that I had no idea about. It was also interesting to finally learn how which styles take precedence.

### 6:14 PM

So today I finished the [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css) and boy, did I learn so many new things. I really am just learning frontend for the first time. I was surprised to see that CSS Variables are already a thing, which is nice. I also finally got to drag- I mean take my juniors along with me.

### 6:13 PM

Today I started [Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design) and got all the way to [Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin Property](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/center-an-element-horizontally-using-the-margin-property). Here, I discovered that several of the HTML tags I used to use have been replaced (e.g. b -> strong) or are done in CSS instead. I've also finally got to understand several of the positioning properties that have always been so troubling for me to grasp and so, I look forward to continuing this.

While quickly waiting for my game to update (since it's 12 GB), I decided to quickly do five challenges while waiting. I'll be doing a lot more later.

So today, I finished the [Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design). I was amazed at how you could do graphics with CSS. But at the same time, I honestly found myself scratching my head with the bezier curves stuff. I wish I could understand it better later down the line since it seems interesting.

### 6:34 PM

After my first sprint, I went on ahead to do the [Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility). I'm surprised at how much meaning there was to several tags like `main`, `article`, `section`, `div`, and several others. Before this, I just thought they all served the same purpose and that they were just some decorative tags. Turns out, it was for accessibility! This wasn't taught to me at school and I could start to see clearly now how self trained individuals could be come really good as long as they have the right learning materials.

Today's father's day and I went out with family (and no, I'm not the father in this holiday). I got home and it's already late, my brain isn't working anymore, and I'm just really tired in general. From this day on, I'll also log all the days I skip my #100DaysOfCode so that I'd be less inclined to skip for lousy reasons. I think today gets a pass though.

### 6:49 PM

So today I completed Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles. Applied Accessibility showed me the importance of properly writing HTML to accommodate different kinds of web browsers including screen readers. There are a bunch of tags to consider and even how you style the page for say, the color blind. Those things never came across to me in the past and now, I'll keep those people in mind whenever I create a webpage.

### 8:00 PM

Today I started and completed the CSS Flexbox part of freeCodeCamp's  Responsive Web Design Certification. Flexbox has always confused me in the past (and honestly still kinda does) but this time, I got to try out how it's different properties work. Seeing how `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow` work feels kinda trippy.

### 7:56 AM

Got to start and finish a little over half of the [Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid) before work hours, I'll continue this later tonight.
