# freeCodeCamp Diary

On the 17th day of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, I kinda hit a stump. I have a project that's written in Kotlin and I'd like to write a frontend for it. Unfortunately, I haven't touched frontend code in, well, forever. And so I've decided to reboot my frontend skills with freeCodeCamp. This diary is something I intend as part of my #100Days of Code and will update it for every sprint I do. Basically if I do work in the morning I update this. If I do work again in the night, I update it again.

This is to hold myself liable, and I could type a lot more here than in Twitter. I'm currently writing this in a salon while waiting for my haircut and it's great how fast their wifi is. What I mean to say is, this is going to be a really messy diary. Have fun going through my messy brain's raw thoughts! (Or not.)

So, I just speeded through freeCodeCamps Basic HTML and HTML5 in the Responsive Web Design Certification after I got home and had dinner. I found that I knew a lot of the topics and so I got through it really quickly. But that's the funny thing...

> I knew a lot of the topics

I was expecting to know most of it! There were so many little tidbits bits that I didn't know or didn't understand. Thing is, I was taking this to relearn frontend but it turns out, I'm actually learning it properly for the first time. I don't really find this disappointing, I'm actually excited by it! Here's to learning frontend, the right way.

I get to the office pretty early so I usually get a bunch of time to mess around. So this time, I got to start with freeCodeCamp's [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css). I went from [Change the Color of Text](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/change-the-color-of-text) to [Size Your Images](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/size-your-images) in about 30 minutes or so. I spent a little more time with each challenge this time because really, my understanding of CSS is pretty shallow.
