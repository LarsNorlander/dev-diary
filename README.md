# freeCodeCamp Diary

## June 11, 2018

### 5:43 PM
On the 17th day of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, I kinda hit a stump. I have a project that's written in Kotlin and I'd like to write a frontend for it. Unfortunately, I haven't touched frontend code in, well, forever. And so I've decided to reboot my frontend skills with freeCodeCamp. This diary is something I intend as part of my #100Days of Code and will update it for every sprint I do. Basically if I do work in the morning I update this. If I do work again in the night, I update it again.

This is to hold myself liable, and I could type a lot more here than in Twitter. I'm currently writing this in a salon while waiting for my haircut and it's great how fast their wifi is. What I mean to say is, this is going to be a really messy diary. Have fun going through my messy brain's raw thoughts! (Or not.)

### 8:43 PM

So, I just speeded through freeCodeCamps Basic HTML and HTML5 in the Responsive Web Design Certification after I got home and had dinner. I found that I knew a lot of the topics and so I got through it really quickly. But that's the funny thing...

> I knew a lot of the topics

I was expecting to know most of it! There were so many little tidbits bits that I didn't know or didn't understand. Thing is, I was taking this to relearn frontend but it turns out, I'm actually learning it properly for the first time. I don't really find this disappointing, I'm actually excited by it! Here's to learning frontend, the right way.

## June 12, 2018

### 7:55 AM

I get to the office pretty early so I usually get a bunch of time to mess around. So this time, I got to start with freeCodeCamp's [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css). I went from [Change the Color of Text](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/change-the-color-of-text) to [Size Your Images](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/size-your-images) in about 30 minutes or so. I spent a little more time with each challenge this time because really, my understanding of CSS is pretty shallow.

### 6:13 PM

Work ends at 5:00PM, and so I spent my time continuing the CSS challenges. This time around I went from [Add Borders Around Your Elements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/add-borders-around-your-elements) to [Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/use-attribute-selectors-to-style-elements). A funny thing that occurred to me was a particular question.

> Why is the unit `em` called that?

This lead to some searching until finally, I found that it's etymology is from typography! I've known in the past that frontend is influenced by some aspects of traditional media, but this was mind blowing for me. I don't know. I guess it's just, I find it amusing that in our day and age, we find inspiration for the technologies of the future in the way we used to do things in the past.

### June 13, 2018

### 7:53 AM

So this morning before work hours, I got to do [Understand Absolute versus Relative Units](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/understand-absolute-versus-relative-units) to [Override All Other Styles by using Important](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/override-all-other-styles-by-using-important). I think this section so far has had the most surprises. There are quite a few things I encountered that I had no idea about. It was also interesting to finally learn how which styles take precedence.

### 6:14 PM

So today I finished the [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css) and boy, did I learn so many new things. I really am just learning frontend for the first time. I was surprised to see that CSS Variables are already a thing, which is nice. I also finally got to drag- I mean take my juniors along with me.

## June 14, 2018

### 6:13 PM

Today I started [Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design) and got all the way to [Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin Property](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/center-an-element-horizontally-using-the-margin-property). Here, I discovered that several of the HTML tags I used to use have been replaced (e.g. b -> strong) or are done in CSS instead. I've also finally got to understand several of the positioning properties that have always been so troubling for me to grasp and so, I look forward to continuing this.

## June 15, 2018

### 5:03 PM

While quickly waiting for my game to update (since it's 12 GB), I decided to quickly do five challenges while waiting. I'll be doing a lot more later.

## June 16, 2018

### 5:43 PM

So today, I finished the [Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design). I was amazed at how you could do graphics with CSS. But at the same time, I honestly found myself scratching my head with the bezier curves stuff. I wish I could understand it better later down the line since it seems interesting.

### 6:34 PM

After my first sprint, I went on ahead to do the [Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility). I'm surprised at how much meaning there was to several tags like `main`, `article`, `section`, `div`, and several others. Before this, I just thought they all served the same purpose and that they were just some decorative tags. Turns out, it was for accessibility! This wasn't taught to me at school and I could start to see clearly now how self trained individuals could be come really good as long as they have the right learning materials.

## June 17, 2018

Today's father's day and I went out with family (and no, I'm not the father in this holiday). I got home and it's already late, my brain isn't working anymore, and I'm just really tired in general. From this day on, I'll also log all the days I skip my #100DaysOfCode so that I'd be less inclined to skip for lousy reasons. I think today gets a pass though.

## June 18, 2018

### 6:49 PM

So today I completed Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles. Applied Accessibility showed me the importance of properly writing HTML to accommodate different kinds of web browsers including screen readers. There are a bunch of tags to consider and even how you style the page for say, the color blind. Those things never came across to me in the past and now, I'll keep those people in mind whenever I create a webpage.

## June 19, 2018

### 8:00 PM

Today I started and completed the CSS Flexbox part of freeCodeCamp's  Responsive Web Design Certification. Flexbox has always confused me in the past (and honestly still kinda does) but this time, I got to try out how it's different properties work. Seeing how `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow` work feels kinda trippy.

## June 20, 2018

### 7:56 AM

Got to start and finish a little over half of the [Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid) before work hours, I'll continue this later tonight.

### 8:37 PM

So I finished the CSS Grid challenges and I'm amazed at what it could do! I've heard that it was just a fairly recent thing too? Back when I tried frontend, Flexbox was kinda the solution I heard all the time when it came to layouts but honestly, I'm not sure what to do without Grid now. I think one of the most fun things about being a dev, is that there's always some new thing that empowers us to do more than we could before. There's always something new to learn and, that's actually the best part. It literally just keeps getting better and better.

The code projects are up and I'm really looking forward to it now.

## June 21, 2018

### 7:55 AM

I pretty much spent my time before work setting up the project challenge. I'm actually amazed at how the projects are checked and how they provide tests for you. I'm now even more excited to do the projects, but I'll have to do them later after work.

### 6:29 PM

So I already have all the tests passing!... Well, technically. It's barely still a tribute page though. What I've done was get all the tests to pass with the minimum amount of work necessary and from there, I tried out experimenting with what I could potentially do without breaking the tests. I also spent time looking at other tributes on CodePen to see how far they were able to go and well, what a tribute page looks like. In the end, I've decided to do a tribute for P!ATD's new album "Pray for the Wicked". It has a few singles out and so far I'm liking it. I have a few idea as to how it would look but we'll see what I get to do with it.

## June 22, 2018

### 7:58 AM

So this morning I started out by filling up some of the HTML I plan to style and sprinkled a few classes in. The classes are there because I know I'll use them for styling later on. I've also just been able to add stub CSS declarations so that I could add styles and watch the page change as I need without having to go into the HTML to see what classes I made (I'm horribly forgetful).

## June 23, 2018

### 6:58 PM

Today I spent my time playing around with Flexbox and Grids to position the items on my tribute page. It's starting to show what each may be best used for given a particular thing you'd like to do. Now that I'm trying to explain it, it's actually kinda hard. I just have a bit of a sense of when to use which and, well, it might be wrong. I'll see.

## June 24, 2018

### 2:46 PM

I've finished up aligning everything and now I'm experimenting with web fonts. It's kinda tough getting something that looks great together. Once I finish up with all the design work, I'll try making it more responsive. The current design only works for mobile and is abysmal for desktop.

## June 25, 2018

### 6:26 PM

I've figured that I was starting to take up too much time on my tribute because I was doing something that was waaaaay too complicated for my level. So I've decided to fork the project and replace it's content. This time around, it's a tribute to Elon Musk. I've read his biography a while back and I thought, "He's a pretty cool dude. I could probably do a tribute to him instead."

## June 26, 2018

### 7:55 AM

Today I spent my time trying to format the tribute, it's getting closer to what I'd like. I think last I'd do would be to make it more responsive and fit for desktop.

### 5:44 PM

I got to get the responsiveness to work! I've used a grid to split the contents into two columns but, now there are a few new problems that I'll have to address. Frontend's fun.

## June 27, 2018

### 7:58 AM

I spent my time trying to figure out flex box so I could have all the items move towards the start. However, the image's margin grows to fill up the entire container. I haven't fixed that yet and just when I thought I only had to worry about desktop, I fired up the mobile simulator in Chrome and turns out, it was broken on mobile. 

### 6:36 PM

I finally decided to submit my tribute project since it already passes the tests and I've been able to style it in a way that I think looks nice. I realized that I've stayed here for too long now and I've decided that, well, I still got a ways to go and shooting for perfection now will just make me miserable. I've already begun the next challenge, a responsive form and I've already passed a couple of the tests.

## June 28, 2018

### 7:58 AM

I've completed the bare basic requirements for the form and all tests are passing. What's left to do now is make a sensible form and style it up.

### 8:54 PM

I've tried making the form a lot more sensible. I guess I have enough to start styling.

## June 29, 2018

### 6:49 PM

I've completed styling the form and made it responsive. I had the form basically have a card look to it and gave it a max-width of 800. Inside the form, I used grids to make two columns of inputs and made it one column when the screen got smaller.

## June 30, 2018

### 8:20 PM

This week was particularly tiring (for some reason) and I spent most of the day sleeping. Despite that, I tried to do my best to get in some code into the product landing page although honestly, it was barely much. Hopefully tomorrow, I'll get to do much much more.

## July 1, 2018

### 12:18 PM

So it turns out, I forgot that CodePen doesn't do autosave. Hence, all my work yesterday was all for naught. Well, it's not like I go to do much anyway. So for the product page, I've decided to do a simple version for the MacBook Pro. It's my main machine and I just love it for doing work so, that's the product page I'm doing.

## July 2, 2018

### 8:38 PM

I completed the product page today. Did quite some work on that menu bar to get it to keep the company logo at the left and the nav items to the right. Typically I'd use a framework but I guess now I have a better understanding of how that works. Two projects left and I'll be saying hello to JS. I'm starting to miss programming.

## July 3, 2018

### 7:47 AM

Started work on the technical documentation page and got a few test cases passing. I'm getting information from MDN thought I might have taken a look at the wrong page. Turns out I need far more code blocks that what's listed at the page I was looking at.

### 5:54 PM

I finished all of the content related tests for the technical documentation. What's left now is to keep the nav bar at the left side of the screen and then add a media query for mobile.

## July 4, 2018

### 7:56 AM

I finished all the test cases now for the technical documentation. What's left now is to properly style the doc and then submit it.
