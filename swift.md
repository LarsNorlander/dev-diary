Got to kick off Swift with the book Learning Swift, 3rd Edition from O'Reilly. Got to read up about the core language itself and it resembles Kotlin quite a bit. If there's one thing I especially found useful, it was the fact that you could make mutable or immutable collection simply by using `var` or `let`.

Couldn't help but have another go at the language and learned about OOP in Swift. Something I found amazing was the fact that you could extend a class to conform to a protocol. That kinda blew my mind. It was also amusing to see that you could also declare your own operations on classes.

Had a go all the way to the Swift Package Manager. I'll read up the rest of the chapter tomorrow since this looks rather long.

Finished up the third chapter and read about the Swift Package Manager. I did stumble on a few problems on my machine though. It might be that there have been some breaking changes made between the publication of the book.

### 11:01 AM

Got to setup the basic project and followed some of the modifications for Selfiegram. Time to build a very original app.

So today, I got to build up the model component of the Selfiegram app. In this I've pretty much created an image, saved it to disk, encoded and decoded JSON from local storage and had unit tests to boot.

Got to add the ability to view available selfies in a list. It displays how long ago a selfie has been taken and a preview. As of now, it's only showing the selfies that have been left out by running my tests.

After all the setbacks and traveling and settling down here in Sweden, I got back up again and started coding. This time, I added the ability to delete items in the list and add new selfies using the camera.

Added the ability to view individual selfies in Selfiegram. I'll work on editing a bit later.
