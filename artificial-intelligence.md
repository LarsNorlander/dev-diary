And so finally, I get to begin my journey through AI. Honestly, this became a sudden priority because I've been thrown right into an AI project. My bosses think I'm one to have fun in learning and so they think it's a suitable assignment. I did want to work on it myself anyway and here it is. My journey starts with Linked Data, the Semantic Web, and Natural Language Processing.

Finally, I won the bidding for an apartment and I'll be signing on it tomorrow. I could now rest, and focus on coding. And well, today I learned about Vagrant. Well, what does that have to do with AI? See, one of the technologies we are using is Mycroft! Unfortunately, it only runs on Linux. There's a Docker version but I don't really have access to it at work. So Vagrant to the rescue! I quickly found out that this tool is probably going to be one of the best tools I'll use as well.

Today, I am committing again to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This time, my goal is to go through all of Manning's learning materials on [Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/bundle-hub/deep-learning). And yes, I actually bought the first bundle. I'm intentionally twisting my arm into studying.

Got to read a bit more about machine learning and how computers learn. I'm getting a little tired now, so I might as well continue tomorrow. No point in forcing myself to study if I can't absorb what I'm reading.
