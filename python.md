I've decided today that after forever, I'd pick up and learn Python. Actually, I want to learn for a couple of things.
I want to use the language as my "Scripting Knife". Basically for quickly whipping up code for doing just about 
anything. That, and I'd like to use it as my language of choice for stuff like CodeSignal or LeetCode. I'm starting out
with the third edition of The Quick Python Book which released last May. I'm looking forward to this.

I've finished reading up on the first chapter of The Quick Python Book and now, I'm a lot more convinced and I look
forward to reading the rest of it. But for now, time for work.

Today I got to learn a whole bunch about Python's list data structure and the things you could do with it. I think today's biggest moment of amusement, is how you could take say, the last three elements of a list and put it at the beginning in one line.

```py
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
x[:-3],x[-3:] = x[-3:],x[:-3]
```

Finished reading about tuples and sets! So tuples are basically immutable lists and sets are basically the mathematical set. One important difference I guess between a set and a list are their lookup times. If I remember correctly, a list's lookup time is linear while a set's is constant. This makes a difference if all you care about is membership in a collection. I also found it amusing that the bitwise operators like `|`, `&`, and `^` work for doing set operations; it feels like it's intuitive too.

This time, I got to read the chapters on strings and dictionaries. The more I read about Python, the more I get excited to try it out and code a bunch of stuff. I've already tried a few problems on hacker rank and it feels so nice being able to use the language to solve problems. It's nice that I could solve them pretty quickly too!

Control flow, functions, generators, and decorators. There's a bunch of stuff in Python for doing a bunch of things huh? It's surprising how many shortcuts the language has for doing different things and now I'm seeing how I may want to use the language. I intend on using it for programming challenges but I'll just read the rest of the book and see what else I could learn. I might use Python for other things too.
