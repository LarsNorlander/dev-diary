# Python

I've decided today that after forever, I'd pick up and learn Python. Actually, I want to learn for a couple of things.
I want to use the language as my "Scripting Knife". Basically for quickly whipping up code for doing just about 
anything. That, and I'd like to use it as my language of choice for stuff like CodeSignal or LeetCode. I'm starting out
with the third edition of The Quick Python Book which released last May. I'm looking forward to this.
